"""Bridge protocol version — leaf module so any part of the package can
import it without cycles.

Reported to the backend at executor registration and WS gateway join
(audit-remediation-plan H3). The backend compares it against
Agentchat.Protocol's @min_bridge_version and refuses/flags outdated bridges
once enforcement is on. Bump on any protocol-relevant change (payload fields
the backend requires, structured-tag semantics, fail-loud contracts).
Distinct from the ACP message-envelope schema_version ("2.0") — they version
different things.
